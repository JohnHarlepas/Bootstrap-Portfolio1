                        <p>Born to two Greek immigrant parents, I have tried to live my life in a way that honors the sacrifices they had to make to give me a chance at a successful life. This has meant living a life filled with generosity, discipline, and hard work.</p>

                    
                        <p>Academically, I graduated from the University of Maryland with degrees in multiple disciplines: Political Science, Communications, and African-American Studies. I also attended graduate school at the University of Louisville in order to work as a teacher in the Kentucky public school system. In every step of my academic life, I held a high GPA and took on leadership roles.</p>


                        <p>In my working life, I have spent a considerable amount of time in public life. I dedicated my early career working with the Department of Veterans Affairs to fix issues facing veterans that dealt with the department. Later, I moved into election system while working with the Department of Elections for Baltimore County (Maryland). Recently, I spent time teaching disadantaged middle school science to 8th graders in Louisville, Kentucky. My efforts earned me a spot and a scholarship with AmeriCorps.</p>

        
                        <p>Moving forward from my public roles, I am currently a graduate of the George Washington Coding Bootcamp. With the support of my awesome girlfriend Connie, I have been able to take on several coding projects and I have earned several accolades for my work.</p>
